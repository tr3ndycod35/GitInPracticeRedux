CHAPTER TWO
This time around, I'm testing the git fetch command. I was told
it fetches the latest commit from a repository without performing
the merge function like git pull.

Modified this file in another branch named Chapter Two. Added some
salting and then save. Just to see how merges are demostrated in 
git.
Isn't that interesting? In fact, I've been finding Git to be interesting
honestly.
