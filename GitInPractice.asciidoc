This is my first file about git
it's like the last person who entered
hell forgot to shut the door.
what do you think?
It's so surprising that the last joke I posted was
rejected by the manager.
Edited on a new branch. Git is becoming interesting
to me. Hopefully it will be useful for me in the nearest
future.

This time around, I'm testing the git fetch command. I was told
it fetches the latest commit from a repository without performing
the merge function like git pull.

Modified this file in another branch named Chapter Two. Added some
salting and then save. Just to see how merges are demostrated in 
git.
Isn't that interesting? In fact, I've been finding Git to be interesting
honestly.
